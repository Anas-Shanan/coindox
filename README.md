- **Responsive Design** — Optimized for various devices via `media.css`

## ⚙️ How to Run

Simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` or `contact.html` file directly in your browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/coindox.git
cd coindox
# Open index.html in your browser
```

Alternatively, use a live server extension if you prefer auto-reloading while editing.

## 📢 Important Notes

- Paths like `/assets/img/...` should ideally be relative (`./assets/img/...`) for better compatibility, especially when hosting the site.
- No JavaScript functionality yet: checkbox toggling (for mobile menu) is handled by HTML/CSS.
- This project is mainly for **frontend practice** — no backend integration (e.g., form submission) is included.
